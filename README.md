# Why OpenBSD rocks

The idea is to create a website that shows great things in OpenBSD to people interested in using it.

# About

I have personally been using OpenBSD since 2012. Every now and then
(at conferences, the office, the local hackerspace) people are asking:

> “You are using OpenBSD? Why?”

There are a bazillion things that are great about OpenBSD - the people, the philosophy and the technology.

# Help!

Everyone is free to create PR(s) as this project relies on help! I'm not an expert on
everything and facts may be missing, have typos or are wrong.

Feel free to open PRs for:

* New facts
* Fix typos
* Add additional references to existing facts
* Layout / CSS / HTML changes
* Correct claims in fact descriptions
* Everything else you can think of

# Deployment

After a PR gets merged or a commit gets pushed by an author, the site will be automatically deployed to our VM

The VM got sponsored by [openbsd.amsterdam](https://openbsd.amsterdam/) ❤️
