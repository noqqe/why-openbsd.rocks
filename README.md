# Why OpenBSD rocks

The idea is to create a website that shows great things in OpenBSD to people interested in using it.

# About

I have personally been using OpenBSD since 2012. Every now and then
(at conferences, the office, the local hackerspace) people are asking:

> “You are using OpenBSD? Why?”

There are a bazillion things that are great about OpenBSD.
The people, the philosophy and the technology.
