title: "/etc/examples"
---

Since most administration is done by editing system configuration files in `etc`,
the `/etc/examples` directory gives administrators a comprehensive set of example configuration files.
At present there are approximately four dozen examples that are designed to be edited and copied into `/etc`.
For example, the file `/etc/examples/pf.conf` is a more complete and more heavily commented version of the
file it can replace, `/etc/pf.conf`.
