title: "base system concept"
---

When you install OpenBSD, you get a base system that contains various
software.

For example, `sshd`, `tmux`, a HTTP Server, `whois` , `doas`, `less`, `make`,
`clang`  & `ftp`. Mostly stuff that is needed day to day by a system
administrator.

A base system with default tools and daemons is a fundamentally different
concept than packaged software with preinstalled packages.
