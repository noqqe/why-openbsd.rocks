title: "signify(1)"
---

`signify` is a small and elegant tool to cryptographically sign and verify
files. It was created to sign OpenBSD releases, since OpenBSD 5.5, and
Binary Patches for [syspatch](/fact/syspatch). It uses only the
[Ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/index.html) algorithm.

Think of it as an simple, easy replacement for PGP signing.
